## One Time Passwords

This allows password generation with an authenticator app.

We could also take this one step further and require a one time password generated by an authenticator app.

To do this, we might return a JSON response like:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "type": "sesion",
    "attributes": {
      "token": "token",
      "otp-required": true
    }
  }
}
```

The user would then `PUT /sessions/{token}` with the userâ€™s generated OTP.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "type": "sesion",
    "attributes": {
      "token": "token",
      "otp-required": true,
      "otp": "5678"
    }
  }
}
```

The response would then container their `auth token`

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "type": "sesion",
    "attributes": {
      "token": null,
      "otp-required": false,
      "auth": "auth token",
      "otp": null
    }
  }
}
```
